This assignment has an image button, an image view and a textview. The image button is the Green Lantern logo and when clicked, the image view cycles between two comic book characters who have been called Green Lantern. The layout changes based on the orientation of the device, and the textview keeps track of how many times the orientation changes. The number of orientation changes and which Green Lantern is being displayed is saved and loaded whenever the home button is pressed and whenever the recent application button is pressed as well. This was done using bundles.
