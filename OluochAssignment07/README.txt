This application uses SQLite and Google Room to create an empty database of superheroes on the main activity that allows users to insert their own. There is a plus button in the bottom corner and when it is clicked, a new activity opens that allows users to enter the hero's name, alter ego, and company of origin. Upon saving, all of this is put into the database and the names of the heroes are placed into a recyclerview on the main activity. Clicking on the newly added names opens up another new activity that displays the name, alter ego and company from the database all on one page. Because of the Database, the information is saved even when the app is closed completely or the device/emulator restarts.
