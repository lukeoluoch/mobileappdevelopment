Assignment: 06

This assignment creates a list of 20 fast food chains to be displayed in a listfragment and a recyclerview. The listfragment displays the names and on click shows the type of food they specialize in, their slogan, and a description. Using a viewpager, you can swipe to the side to see the recyclerviewer, which instead had a red background and displayed all the information. Recyclerview has the advangtages of being more flexible in terms of layout (being more than just a vertical list) and can also be used creatively with animations and decorations in ways listviews can't.
